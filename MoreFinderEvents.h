It's VERY simple.	It ignores any event it may receive, and returns a resonable sleep value	and a nil mouse region. This is not enough for any but the most trivial	of applications.	If the application using these functions has windows, then the idle function	will receive update, activate, osEvt, and null events. Because of this,	you must supply a more complete and robust idle function than the defaule	idle function included with this library.		In most cases, the events received by the idle function can simply be	sent to the application's do event routine. You will also want to supply	appropriate values for the sleep and mouseRgn parameters.		See Inside Macintosh: Interapplicatins Communications for more about	idle functions.
